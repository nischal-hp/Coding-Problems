# Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.
# An input string is valid if:
# Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
# Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
 

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "()"
# Output: true
# Example 2:

# Input: s = "()[]{}"
# Output: true
# Example 3:

# Input: s = "(]"
# Output: false
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= s.length <= 104
# s consists of parentheses only '()[]{}'.

# Solution 1 : We use a Dictionary to keep track of the opening and closing bracket combination.
# Use a stack to keep track of the characters in the string.
# Time : O(n), Space : O(n) because of the use of stack.

class Solution(object):
	def isValid(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
        d = {'(':')', '{':'}','[':']'}
        stack = []
        for i in s:
            if i in d:  # 1
                stack.append(i)
            elif len(stack) == 0 or d[stack.pop()] != i:  # 2
                return False
        return len(stack) == 0 # 3
	
# 1. if it's the left bracket then we append it to the stack
# 2. else if it's the right bracket and the stack is empty(meaning no matching left bracket), or the left bracket doesn't match
# 3. finally check if the stack still contains unmatched left bracket

# Solution 2 : Without using Stack
# Can use a replace function, and go on replacing the occurance of opening and closing brackets with an empty string.
# Keep repeating this until the string is empty.
# Also check at every step, if the length after replace is equal to before replace. This way can return False immideately if there are no matching strings.

            if l==len(s): return False   # IMP : Even after replace if its the same, that means we do not have a valid combination
